    <p class="descreption">Cheesy garlic bread is a popular type of bread that is flavored with garlic and melted cheese. It typically starts with a loaf of bread, such as French or Italian, which is sliced and then spread with a garlic butter mixture made from butter, minced garlic, and often herbs like parsley or oregano. The bread is then topped with grated cheese, such as mozzarella or parmesan, and baked until the cheese is melted and bubbly. The result is a crispy and savory bread with a rich garlic flavor and gooey melted cheese on top. Cheesy garlic bread is often served as an appetizer, side dish, or accompaniment to soups, salads, or pasta dishes. It is a favorite comfort food for many people and is easy to make at home.</p>
