     <p class="description">Beignets are a popular fried pastry that originated in France and are now commonly associated with New Orleans, Louisiana. They are made from a simple dough of flour, water, sugar, and yeast, which is rolled out, cut into squares or circles, and then fried until puffy and golden brown. Beignets are typically served hot and dusted with powdered sugar, and can be enjoyed as a breakfast treat, a dessert, or a snack. They are crispy on the outside and soft and doughy on the inside, with a slightly sweet flavor. Beignets are often enjoyed with a cup of coffee, and are a beloved part of Louisiana cuisine and culture.</p>

     <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

     <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon yeast</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons monk fruit sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>Confectioners sugar (to sprinkel)</li>
        <li>Additional 2 quarts of vegetable oil for frying</li>
     </ul>

     <h3 class="directions">Steps</h3>

     <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the water, yeast, and sugar. Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the eggs and 2 tablespoons of oil into yeast mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, salt and stir together until well combined. The dough will be a bit sticky, that's ok.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl, let dough sit at room temp for about an hour, until it has nearly doubled in size. </li>
        <li>Pour the 2 quarts of oil into a heavy bottomed Dutch oven or large skillet, it should fill the bottom of the pot 2-3 inches. Heat over medium to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough onto a floured counter and cut in half. With one half of the dough, pat into a rectangular shape , flipping to coat with flour. Roll dough out into ¼-inch-thick rectangle.</li>
        <li>Using a pizza cutter, cut dough into twelve 3-inch squares.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process with the second piece of dough.</li>
        <li>When the oil is 350℉ add a few beignets at a time. Fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes total, flipping halfway through frying.</li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Dust heavily with confectioners sugar and serve warm.</li>
     </ol>
